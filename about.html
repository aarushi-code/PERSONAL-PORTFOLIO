          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>Currently a second year undergraduate student at SRM University Chennai, I study Computer Science Engineering. My prime focus has always been on developing proficiency and excelling in whatever I do, be it Web development, Machine Learning or following my passion-speaking and debating, I am never hesitent to try my hands on these skills. My aim is to integrate ML,Web and AI for the betterment of mankind.   
          </p>

          <p>Often I discover my friends being perplexed about what to achieve in life,which route to choose and how. So, to resolve this very grave issue in a student's career, I decided to contribute in whatever way I can. This led me to launching my own personal website, where students can connect with me and I can do my part by helping them out on career choices.  </p>
